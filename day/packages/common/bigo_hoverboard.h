/* bigo_hoverboard.h -- wedge-shaped hover skateboards ("air ships"). EMILY/BACKLOG.md SECTION 536
 * follow-up, founder real-time (2026-09-24): "add air ships like wedge shaped hover skateboards
 * they have different physics per board and they can be programmed in parena friction and gravity
 * etc can be tuned".
 *
 * Real, own design -- a new BIG_O mechanic, not a reverse-port. Three board types
 * (BIGO_BOARD_SPEEDSTER/TANK/GLIDER), each a real, genuinely different feel: SPEEDSTER is fast and
 * slippery with a floaty jump, TANK snaps off the line but tops out slow and hugs the ground,
 * GLIDER is the real "air ship" of the three -- gentle accel, gravity scaled way down for long
 * airtime over gaps. The four tuned constants per board (`day/packages/simulation/
 * hoverboard_rules.c`, generated from `PARENA/stdlib/big_o/hoverboard_rules.prn`) are pure PARENA
 * lookups; momentum integration itself is real, stateful host math (velocity carries across
 * ticks), same "mods first everything" split every other BIG_O PARENA consumer header draws.
 *
 * Pure C99, no GL/SDL/network -- same "state in, mutate, read back" contract bigo_party.h/
 * bigo_chat.h already establish. The host (day/apps/server/src/main.c) owns per-player mount
 * state and calls bigo_hoverboard_tick() once per movement tick while mounted, in place of (not
 * alongside) the normal direct-input on-foot horizontal movement.

 * Every board's own real natural coasting speed (accel / -ln(friction), the point where
 * acceleration and drag balance) comfortably exceeds its own max-speed cap, so max_speed is what
