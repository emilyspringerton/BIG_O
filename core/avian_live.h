/* avian_live.h -- pure glue wiring core/avian_values.h's coalition into the OTHER AI actors
 * already ticking on the live server: core/npc_archetype.h (Citizens/The Men), core/
 * zombie_values.h (zombies), core/witness_rules.h (the human witness-state machine). Founder
 * real-time follow-up to NORTHSTAR.md §31 ("the birds"): "integrate them deeply into the other AI
 * interactions in terms of observing the observer."
 *
 * "Observing the observer" is a specific, real design choice, not a slogan: this coalition does
 * NOT get its own copy of witness_rules.c's noticed()/conspicuousness() to watch the player
 * directly (that would just be a second, redundant witness system with bird flavor). Instead the
 * coalition watches the OTHER watchers -- a citizen's or The Men's own npc_brain_effective_
 * vigilance spiking, a human's own witness_state escalating past mere DENIAL, a zombie crossing
 * into a witnessable HUNTING/FRENZIED state (core/witness_live.h's own bigo_zombie_is_
 * witnessable_event). Each of those IS already one AI system noticing something -- the coalition's
 * real job, matching TYLER/README.md's Eastwind Owls ("their inability to destroy records is a
 * feature, not a bug"), is to archive the fact that a witnessing already happened and broadcast
 * it onward (avian_values.h's own avian_beacon_strength), one meta-layer above the event itself.
 * A bird never needs its own line of sight to the player to become alarmed -- it only needs to
 * see a citizen flinch, a witness go SILENCING, or a zombie go FRENZIED. This is genuinely
 * different information than what witness_rules.c/zombie_values.c already produce for their own
 * consumers -- it is a second-order signal (a signal ABOUT another AI's own signal), not a
 * restatement of the first-order one, which is the actual mechanical meaning of "observing the
 * observer" here rather than just a re-skinned witness check.
 *
 * Deliberately header-only and pure, same "extract testable logic, zero live-entity dependency"
 * discipline as witness_live.h/bigo_pheromone.h -- every function here takes plain scalars a
 * future ServerAvian tick loop would read off the SAME ServerNpc/ServerZombie arrays apps/server/
 * src/main.c already populates (§8d), not a new entity type of its own. */

 * engaging). Compared directly against the raw WS_* ordinal (UNAWARE < DENIAL < COMPROMISED <
 * SILENCING < PANIC < ENGAGE, exactly the enum's own declared order in witness_rules.h) --
 * deliberately NOT witness_rules.c's own escalation_rank(), which is a different, non-monotonic
 * grouping used for decorum-penalty banding (rank 3 = {SILENCING, ENGAGE}, rank 1 = {DENIAL,
 * PANIC}, rank 0 = {UNAWARE, COMPROMISED} -- COMPROMISED and UNAWARE share a rank there, which
 * would make this threshold meaningless if reused for "has this become a real thread yet"). */
